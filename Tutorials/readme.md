```codes
Angular 1.5 takes a big step towards preparing developers for a smoother transition to Angular 2 in the future.  
Architecting your applications using components, multi-slot transclusion, one-way bindings in isolate scopes, using lifecycle hooks in directive controllers and relying on native ES6 features (such as classes and arrow functions) are now all possible with Angular 1.5.
